      Have you ever dreamed of waking up and finding yourself in a kind of
      paradise, where the only music you hear is birdsong, or the splashing of
      water as a duck lands on a tranquil lake? A place where there are big,
      wide-open skies, filled with stars sparkling when night falls, and the
      moon casts shadows as an owl hoots in the darkness beyond. This defines
      The Dock of the Bay, our beautiful holiday home in the Cambridgeshire
      Fens.

      Come on in, take a look at our website and you, too, can live this dream!
      Here, you will find everything you need to know about this very special
      place... ...our little piece of Heaven that gently fell to Earth.
