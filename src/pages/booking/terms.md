Reservations of The Dock of the Bay, hereinafter referred to as the ‘holiday lodge’, whether made by telephone, in person, in writing or via the internet, are accepted by the Owners, Roland and Susan C Brown, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Owners’, on the following conditions:

1. The Hirers must adhere to the Park Rules and regulations determined by Pure Leisure, in relation to Tydd St Giles Golf and Country Club, hereinafter referred to as ‘PL’ and ‘TSGG&CC’. These must also include the Government Regulations and Guidance in force at any time, in respect of the coronavirus/Covid-19 pandemic 2021 and beyond.
2. ## Contract of Hire

   The hiring contract will be between you, the Hirer, and us, the Owners of the holiday lodge for which the booking is made, and shall be deemed to be made subject to the Conditions of Hire and governed by English Law.  The Contract of Hire is not effective until confirmation of the booking is confirmed by the Hirer either in writing or by email.  The contract is for the hire of the property for holiday purposes only.  We do not accept bookings from Hirers under 21 years of age.
3. ## Initial Payment

   Bookings will be confirmed upon receipt of the required deposit payment of 25% of the total holiday cost.  If the booking is made within six weeks of the holiday commencement date, the full accommodation rental will be required at the time of booking.  Deposits can be paid by cheque or Bank Transfer.
4. ## Balance Payment

   The balance of the hire will be due for payment six weeks before the holiday commencement date.  The Owners reserve the right to cancel the holiday where full payment has not been received less than 28 days before the holiday commencement date.  The deposit paid on the booking is non-returnable.  Once full payment has been received, the Owners will issue a confirmation of booking.
5. ## Method of Payment

   Cheques should be made payable to R & S C Brown or, if by Bank Transfer, details current at time of booking will be provided.
6. ## Cancellation

   If you are forced to cancel your holiday, you must inform the Owners as soon as possible.  The day we receive your notice to cancel is the date on which we will cancel your booking.

   At the sole discretion of the Owners, consideration may be given to a full or partial refund of monies paid, depending on the circumstances, unless we are able to re-let all or part of the period booked.
7. ## Amenities

   The use of accommodation and amenities where offered, such as the swimming pool and associated leisure centre facilities, the fishing lake and the golf course etc, is entirely at the users’ risk and no responsibility can be accepted for injury to users or visitors, or loss or damage to their belongings.  The Owners cannot accept any responsibility for the unavailability of any of the amenities/facilities within the TSGG&CC site at the time of the booking period.
8. ## Party Numbers

   In no circumstances may more than the maximum number of six persons occupy the holiday lodge.  The Owners reserve the right to refuse admittance if this condition is not observed.

   The person who completes the booking must certify that he or she is authorised to agree to the Booking Conditions on behalf of all members of the party. The lead name must be over 21 years of age and a member of the party occupying the holiday lodge.  The lead name agrees to take responsibility for all members of the party. The Owners of the holiday lodge reserve the right to refuse or revoke any bookings from parties that may, in their opinion, (and at their sole discretion) be unsuitable for the holiday lodge.
9. ## Your Responsibilities

   For the whole of the period included within your booking, you will be responsible for the holiday lodge and will be expected to take all reasonable care of it.  Should there be any specific health or mobility difficulties which may affect a party member, please contact the Owners for details as to the suitability of access to the holiday lodge at the time of reservation.  The holiday lodge and all equipment and utensils must be left clean and tidy at the end of the hire period.  The holiday lodge can be occupied from 3.00pm on the day of arrival, and must be vacated by 10.00am on the day of departure.
10. ## Damage

    All damages and breakages are the legal responsibility of you, the Hirer, and should be notified to the Owners before the end of your holiday. The cost of damage or breakages shall be payable on demand. Normally, minor damages or breakages will not be charged, but in circumstances where extra cleaning is required, or there has been breakage or damage beyond what is reasonably to be expected, the Owners reserve the right to charge you any additional costs incurred as a consequence and may, at their discretion, refuse further bookings. In any event, we will request a £100 security deposit one week before arrival, which we will refund within 10 days of departure if there is no cause to retain it, for reasons of damage or additional cleaning.

    On arrival, should any damage or non-working items be found, they must be reported to the Owners immediately, so that matters can be rectified.  The Owners have the right to enter the property (without prior notice if this is not practical or possible) if special circumstances or emergencies arise (for example, if repairs have to be carried out)
11. ## Availability

    The Hiring Contract is made on the understanding that the holiday lodge and its facilities will be available for the dates stated. In the unlikely event that the holiday lodge is not available through events arising outside the control of the Owners, then the Owners may be forced to cancel the booking.  The Hirer will be advised as early as possible and will be entitled to a refund of all monies paid. The Hirer will not, as a result, have any further claims against the Owners i.e. any refund as ‘compensation’ will be limited to the total amount paid for the cancelled booking.
12. ## Smoking/Vaping Policy

    The holiday lodge has a ‘**STRICTLY NO SMOKING/NO VAPING**’ policy and this forms part of the Booking Conditions.
13. ## Pet Policy

    \*A ‘**STRICTLY NO PETS**’ policy is applicable to the holiday lodge and this forms part of the Booking Conditions. Should a pet be found living, or have lived, in the property during the Hirer’s stay, a payment of £50 will be imposed to cover the cost of a ‘deep clean’.`
14. ## Hen/Stag Parties and Similar Events

    The Owners do not accept group bookings for Hen/Stag Parties and Similar Events and this forms part of the Booking Conditions.
