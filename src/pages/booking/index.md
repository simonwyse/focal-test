This is our Official Bookings page.  We are currently only letting The Dock of the Bay through enquiries made via our website.  We will always try to be competitive on price, compared with lodges of similar, luxury status, and provide additional benefits, for example, bathroom towels and a complimentary ‘Welcome Basket’ of consumable gifts.

Why not take a look at our [FAQs](/faq/) page and see what else is on offer?

If you fancy getting in touch, please select your preferred arrival date and then departure date to check availability and price. Then, add your details to the form below,
and we will be in contact very soon. We ask for a minimum of three nights, and for you to agree to our booking terms, found in the form below.
