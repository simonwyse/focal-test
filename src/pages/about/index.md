We would like to introduce you to ourselves and The Dock of the Bay, our fabulous, holiday home!

We are Roland and Susie Brown, a retired couple who live just outside of a pleasant, market town in the west of Cambridgeshire. With our son and daughter having fled our cosy nest several years ago, and made their own homes, in which they produced our four grandsons, we decided to search for our aspiration of a small property nearer the sea...a place where we could escape the hustle and bustle of our busy world, find relaxation and the opportunity to pursue our different interests.

So, here we are! We found this bijou gem, just over an hour away.
It was ‘love at first sight’, as we viewed the calming, sky blue decor, the serenity of the shimmering lake and the tranquil green of the 5th fairway and the nature reserve beyond.
With the beautiful, coastal areas of West and North Norfolk within easy reach, we had found our dream.  For sentimental reasons, we named our retreat,

**‘The Dock of the Bay...our little piece of Heaven that gently fell to Earth’**

Welcome...we would love to share it with you!
