The Holiday Park is part of the Tydd St Giles Golf & Country Club, located within the relaxing peace and tranquility of its 150 acres in the Cambridgeshire Fens. It is considered a golfers paradise, with the immaculate 18 hole golf course, and a stunning lake which provides a good fishing opportunity. But there is so much more on offer! The incredible, oak-framed Leisure Complex houses an indoor heated swimming pool and associated facilities, including a two storey gym, not to mention three venues for eating and drinking.

This exclusive collection of holiday homes, of which our luxury, lakeside lodge is part, borders Norfolk and Lincolnshire, giving easy access to the North Norfolk coast and its bountiful beaches, together with the many tourist attractions within East Anglia.
